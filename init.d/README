This directory contains some scripts for auto-starting BackupPC
on boot.

The subdirectory src contains source versions of these scripts (before
various absolute paths have been filled in).

Here are instrcutions for different OSs.  Please submit additions
or improvements to this list!

RedHat Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script linux-backuppc is created. It
should be copied to /etc/init.d/backuppc:

    cp linux-backuppc /etc/init.d/backuppc

After copying it, you can test it by running these commands as root:

    /etc/init.d/backuppc start
    /etc/init.d/backuppc status
    /etc/init.d/backuppc stop

You should then run the following commands as root:

    chkconfig --add backuppc
    chkconfig --level 345 backuppc on
    chkconfig --list backuppc

This will auto-start backuppc at run levels 3, 4 and 5.

Solaris:
=======

When configure.pl is run the shell script solaris-backuppc is created.
This should be copied to /etc/init.d and links made in /etc/rc3.d
and /etc/rc0.d.

    cp solaris-backuppc /etc/init.d/backuppc
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backuppc /etc/rc3.d/S85backuppc
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backuppc /etc/rc0.d/K85backuppc

This will auto-start backuppc at run level 3 and stop it at run level 0.

*** NOTE: the solaris startup script and instructions have not been tested ***
