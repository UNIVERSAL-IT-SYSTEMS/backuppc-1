# Host file list for BackupPC.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This file lists all the hosts that should be backed up by
#   BackupPC.
#
#   Each line in the hosts file contains three fields, separated
#   by white space:
#
#     - The host name.  If this host is a static IP address this
#       must the machine's IP host name (ie: something that can
#       be looked up using nslookup or DSN).  If this is a DHCP
#       host then the host name must be the netbios name of the
#       machine.
#
#     - DHCP flag.  Set to 0 if this is a static IP address host.
#       Otherwise, set to 1 for DHCP hosts.
#
#     - User name (unix login/email name) of the user who "owns"
#       or uses this machine.  This is the user who will be sent
#       email about this machine, and this user will have permission
#       to stop/start/browse/restore backups for this host.
